# Nice to meet you! I'm Bernardo (beMimg)

## Last update - May 2024
I've completed The Odin Project! Now, I'm excited to dive into TypeScript and take my skills to the next level. It feels great to be learning something new again. Currently, I'm working on a website for a pizza restaurant, which marks my first real project with an actual company. It's a full-stack project. The restaurant owner will have the ability to easily manage the menu by adding, deleting, or modifying items as needed through an admin dashboard.

## About me
I've been working in tourism industry for most of my life, but 2022 was a game-changer when I found out I was going to be a dad. That lit a fire under me to chase after my dreams like never before. Programming has always fascinated me, and now I'm determined to turn that fascination into a fulfilling career.

Though I'm still in the tourism industry, I've been actively immersing myself in coding. Every day, I'm committed to learning new tools and writing code because I'm determined to make programming my career.

Throughout my programming journey, I've been actively engaged in [The Odin Project Community](https://github.com/TheOdinProject). Whether seeking advice on best practices, offering assistance to others, or contributing to the open-source curriculum.
